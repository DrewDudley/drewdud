                    Hello

                <span>
                    My name's Drew. I'm a 24 year old UI developer based in St. Louis, Missouri working at a company called
                    <a href="http://www.bullhorn.com" target="_blank">Bullhorn</a>. Some of my favorite things are playing music,
                    watching movies, traveling, and programming. I saw my first line of code back in January of 2014,
                    and then went on to graduate in May of 2016 with a B.S. in
                    <a href="http://www.sbuniv.edu/academics/programs/web-systems-design.php" target="_blank">Web Systems &amp; Design</a>
                    from a small school in southwestern Missouri called Southwest Baptist University. I built this small portfolio
                    to network and connect with other developers, as well as an excuse to play around more with Angular's CLI.
