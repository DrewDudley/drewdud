            My name is Drew Dudley and I am a 23 year old UI developer currently based in St. Louis, Missouri. 
            About a year ago I graduated from a small school in Bolivar, Missouri called Southwest Baptist 
            University with a B.S. in Web Systems and Design, and haven't stopped learning since. I have many 
            passions including music, traveling, and of course, programming. I built this portfolio to showcase myself 
            to fellow developers that I meet, as well as to practice my Angular2 skills. Since you've come this far, so 
            you might as well <a href="#skills" class="link hover-link">keep going</a> and see what I know, and maybe even learn a 
            little bit more about me.
