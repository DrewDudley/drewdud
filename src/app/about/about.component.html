          Hello
        </p>
        <span>
          My name's Drew. I'm a 23 year old UI developer based in St. Louis, Missouri 
          working at a company called <a href="http://www.bullhorn.com" target="_blank">
          Bullhorn</a>. I saw my first line of code in January of 2014, and then went 
          on to graduate in May of 2016 with a B.S. in 
          <a href="http://www.sbuniv.edu/academics/programs/web-systems-design.php" target="_blank">
          Web Systems &amp; Design</a> from a small school in southwestern Missouri called 
          Southwest Baptist University. I'm passionate about a lot of things including music, traveling, user-experience, 
          and of course, programming. I built this small portfolio to showcase myself to 
          other developers that I meet, as well as to get some more experience with Angular's CLI.
