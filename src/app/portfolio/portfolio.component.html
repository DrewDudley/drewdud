			My (humble) portfolio

      I've only been in the game for a short time, but I've had the privilege to work on projects for some pretty cool businesses and 
      organizations, and these are some of my favorites. It's also worth mentioning that some of the content and formatting has since 
      been altered after handing over admin rights to the respective organizations. I love what I do, and I'd be more than happy to talk about any 
      of these projects, as well as my decision-making processes, frameworks, and methodologies I chose for each. Every site that I work on is 
      mobile-friendly and responsive, so feel free to resize your browser or open up dev tools. I'm always looking for fun challenges and freelance 
      work, so if you think of something interesting to work on, or need a website of your very own (made with <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>), 
      <a href="#contact" class="link">reach out to me</a>.
