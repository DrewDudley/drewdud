			I've only been in the development game for a few years, but in that short amount of time I've been lucky enough to get to work on some pretty cool projects 
      for some great businesses and organizations. I love what I do, so I'd be more than willing to talk about any of these projects, as well as my 
      decision-making processes and methodology I chose for each. I'm also always looking for new ideas and fun challenges, so if think of something fun 
      or interesting to work on (or need a website of your own, made with <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>) 
      <a href="#contact" class="link hover-link">reach out to me</a>.
