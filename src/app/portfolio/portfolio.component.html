            These are some pretty small projects I've worked on in the past that I really enjoyed. It's worth mentioning that some of the content and formatting has since
            been altered after handing over admin rights to the respective organizations. Every site that I work on is
            mobile-friendly and responsive, so feel free to resize your browser or open up dev tools. The more technical stuff that I've built and collaborated on
            post-college have all been side projects that are in private repos and owned by Bullhorn, but I would be more that happy to talk about the specifics
            with anyone interested. I'm always looking for fun challenges and freelance work, so if you think of something interesting to work on,
