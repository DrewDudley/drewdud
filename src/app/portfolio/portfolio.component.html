            These are some projects I worked on in college that I really enjoyed. The codebases aren't terribly complex, but the organizations that the
            first 3 were built for are exceptional. It's also worth mentioning that some of the content and formatting has since 
            been altered after handing over admin rights to the respective organizations. I love what I do, and I'd be more than happy to talk about any 
            of these projects, as well as my decision-making processes, frameworks, and methodologies I chose for each. Every site that I work on is 
            mobile-friendly and responsive, so feel free to resize your browser or open up dev tools. The more technical stuff that I've built and collaborated on
            post-college have all been side projects that are in private repos and owned by Bullhorn, but I would be more that happy to talk about the specifics
            with anyone interested. I'm always looking for fun challenges and freelance work, so if you think of something interesting to work on,
            or need a website of your very own (made with <i class="fas fa-heart"></i>), <a href="#contact" class="link">reach out to me</a>.
